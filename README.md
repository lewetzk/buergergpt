# BürgerGPT - Unemployment Benefits Chatbot

## Project Overview

Welcome to BürgerGPT, an early development chatbot designed to assist individuals in navigating the complex process of applying for German unemployment benefits, commonly known as "Bürgergeld." The current state of the application process is non-digitized, not user-friendly, and often challenging for both German and non-German speakers. BürgerGPT aims to bridge these gaps by providing support, answering questions, and simplifying the application journey.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:**
  - BürgerGPT is designed to communicate in both English and German, ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base.

- **Information Retrieval:**
  - The backend, powered by GPT 3.5, leverages the entirety of the "Sozialgesetzbuch II" (SGB II) or the Bürgergeld manual, along with additional documentation from the job center. This vast knowledge base allows BürgerGPT to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

- **Form Assistance:**
  - The chatbot assists users in understanding which forms to fill out, providing step-by-step guidance to ensure a smooth application process.

- **Technical Term Translation:**
  - The chatbot simplifies the process by translating and explaining technical terms commonly used in the application procedure.

- **Reducing Wait Times:**
  - Recognizing that applying for Bürgergeld is complicated for both German and non-German speakers, BürgerGPT aims to alleviate the burden of long waits in hotlines and unnecessary appointments.
